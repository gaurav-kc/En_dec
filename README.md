# En_Dec
This project is to encrypt and create fixed sized chunks of bunch of files and also to decrypt and recover all original files. 
It would encrypt all files into specified size chunks (which can be easy to upload on drive or transfer) and the decode.py file can decrypt and recover all the files.
Right now, directory in directory is not supported. However one can convert all files in a directory into encrypted chunks and then recover all original files from encrypted chunks.
